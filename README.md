# COMSE6998_KWS_Project

This repository showcases a project primarily aimed at enhancing accuracy in deep learning-based keyword spotting.
It builds upon the state-of-the-art approach outlined in “Keyword Spotting -- Detecting Commands in Speech Using Deep Learning.”
The modifications involve adapting the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and Attention Mechanisms, to improve performance.
The Google Speech Commands Dataset Version 2 serves as the primary dataset for training and evaluating the models.
